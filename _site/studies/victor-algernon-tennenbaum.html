<h3 id="recovered-from-damaged-volume-cx99834-augustine-prime">Recovered from damaged volume CX/99834 Augustine Prime</h3>
<p>See him as he walks the streets of his homeworld Gravenstadt. Pelted with rain he passes Flickermen, their holo-projectors glitching and stuttering, neon images reflected into multitudes by the puddling waters. He is young here, an heir, born of noble blood – albeit a line already tainted by my touch. Attired richly he walks with the swagger of confidence, he is destined for great things. Yet he will see his world come apart just weeks from now, he won’t see my hand. Not yet.</p>

<p>See him now, grief stricken and wounded. He screams as he fires an autogun held to his shoulder from a broken window. A speeder flees, and with it his prey. Spent shells cascade into the street below. It is raining here too. He has taken the first steps on a dark path, one that leads to our first encounter.</p>

<p>He leaves a friend dead, and another irreparably changed in his wake; this is why he screams into the sheeting rain. For his vengeance – that and an unspoken desire to keep his first steps down the path of the radical confidential.</p>

<p>Men speak of turning points in their lives; times that divide what was their life before and what their life will become – a liminal time. Augustine was one of these times for Tenenbaum. He doesn’t realise it here, but he will. He will look back on this moment of bellowed rage – his fury pouring out as it never had before. He will leave that bastard world wounded, not just physically but spiritually. He will learn this rage, it will be used as a weapon – first a blunt cudgel grasped in desperation, but later a keen stiletto blade driven deftly at his foes – at me.</p>

<p>He is to become a great man. A great man, but not a good man.</p>

<p>Now, he is older. A departure from the pious youth he was, no longer attired in the trappings of wealth and pomp. He has become the eternal pragmatist, hardship has made him such. A sorcerer, a necromancer, a meddler in matters prohibited – he is here because of me, because of my hand. I set him on this path.</p>

<p>A beard of rust and salt mark his cheeks. Cheeks that are leaner now. Notice how he is marked, by scars, but also with other things self made, marks of power, warding, and control. He hides them beneath cowls and gloves, but I can see; imagine how he is marked internally.</p>

<p>Clutched to him are pouches and bags, stuffed with esoteric items and trinkets; the better to ply his trade. Still you can see – amongst the others – clutched to him is that weapon — the finely wrought pistol that started this; his decent. He rarely uses it now, he has learnt to avoid its touch – but still it is there, at his side. As intended.</p>

<p>His birth-world reached out to him, drew him home in it’s time of need. Thought cleansed decades ago the taint lingered in its bowels and has risen anew. Tennenbaum couldn’t resist the call, against his master’s wishes he has returned – he believes as would-be saviour. I know different, this is just as planned.</p>

      <p>I've been making minis for about 30 years since stumbling across some space marines at a carboot sale before getting into 2nd ed 40k.</p>
      <p>Nowadays I'm mostly making weird narrative models for I28 and posting them on Instagram. But as all social media seems to be going down the toilet and well, I used to make websites for a living, I though I might do this the old school way and show off my stuff here...</p>
