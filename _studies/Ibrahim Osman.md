**An active and long-serving member of Tenenbaum's retinue, formerly of the Astra Militarum serving initially in the esteemed recon companies of the Arakine Dust Stalkers**

### From the memoirs of Tenenbaum
Hailing from Arakine, that ill-fated world blasted to dust and salt, he is an marksman and tracker without equal.

Assigned first to Inquisition service and then later attached to my team in the wynds beneath the hives on Fafnir Halt, at the start of my career – when I still held the rank of Interrogator under Gloriana Freemantle. He distinguished himself tracking and eliminating the so called ‘Blessed Spectres’ of the Djinn-cults there and then joined us on Augustine; he has remained a staple of my retinue since.
