This website has gone through many iterations of itself, it has been both my portfolio and a fully fledged 'marketing' site for my freelancing. I've used it as a means to test new techniques and to validate approaches for clients, this time, and this new iteration is working the other way. 
### I'll update my portfolio soon... 
Forever putting off updating my portfolio, anything that did get posted up was always in a rush ahead of an important meeting or similar. Previously I had run a Wordpress site, and while it worked fine, it was overkill for what I needed - and that added complexity would put me off updating... and on and on...

I had long been eyeing Jekyll as a more suitable tool for my site, and with lockdown becoming the norm I intended to spend some time using it to build a new leaner website. 

As soon as I decided that, more work came in. Fortunately however it was to redesign a Jekyll website! 

### Switching to Jekyll
Being able to learn the ins and outs of the system as part of that job I decided to take the plunge and finally switch over. This website is the fruits of that decision. 

My intention with this site is that is be a living Portfolio of my work. I'm splitting out the freelance side of it and keeping a clear deliniation. 

As I complete projects, I intend to add the case studies as I go and keep it updated - we shall see how that pans out, but the will is there. I'll also be enhancing this site as I go, something online is better than nothing and my Wordpress site had grown long in the tooth. My goal is to keep the site lean, quick to load and easy to update. No database, no complex javascript, just back to where I started with the web - HTML and CSS. 

As for the blog functionality, I'm not sure what that will become yet if anything. But I intend to document any gotchas with the process, any useful aspects I may want to refer back to and then see what happens.
