Created for personal use, so you don't have to risk your offical cards in day to day use. 

Of course, you wouldn't want to spill a drink on them or something would you? That's why you'd use these, not because you couldn't get hold of the offical ones, obviously.

### What's included?
All the magic cards in the big blue book, the Ravening hordes and the good guys and then the PDF legend ones, with the exception of Skaven, Chaos Dwarves and Dark Elves. So a big fat set.

They're available in two formats, one for professional print shops (with trim marks & bleed), and one for your home printer. They're sized to fit into card sleeves for longevity. 

I'd recommend getting these printed by your friendly local printer with the following specs:
- Size 120 x 80mm, 2pp.
- Printed 4 colour both sides onto 350gsm Silk. 
- Gloss laminate on both sides.
- Round corner all corners.
