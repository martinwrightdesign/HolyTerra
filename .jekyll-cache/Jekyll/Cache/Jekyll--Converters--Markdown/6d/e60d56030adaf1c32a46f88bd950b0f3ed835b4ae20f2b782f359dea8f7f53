I"*<p><strong>An active and long-serving member of Tenenbaum’s retinue, formerly of the Astra Militarum serving initially in the esteemed recon companies of the Arakine Dust Stalkers</strong></p>

<p>Hailing from Arakine, that ill-fated world blasted to dust and salt, he is an marksman and tracker without equal.</p>

<p>Assigned first to Inquisition service and then later attached to my team in the wynds beneath the hives on Fafnir Halt, at the start of my career – when I still held the rank of Interrogator under Gloriana Freemantle. He distinguished himself tracking and eliminating the so called ‘Blessed Spectres’ of the Djinn-cults there and then joined us on Augustine; he has remained a staple of my retinue since.</p>
