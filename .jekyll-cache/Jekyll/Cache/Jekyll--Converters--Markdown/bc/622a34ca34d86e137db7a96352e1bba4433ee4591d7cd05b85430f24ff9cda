I"O<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="/blog/a-new-start">first post here</a>, this website was stiched together at speed to update what was an creaking old Wordpress site. Unfortunately, I didn’t take my own advice and build without accessibility as a primary concern - now I’m working to address that.</p>

<p>I started by wanting to add a dark mode, and out of curiosity ran a Lighthouse audit…</p>

<h3 id="just-how-bad-is-it">Just how bad is it?</h3>
<p>According to Lighthouse, it isn’t great.</p>

<p>I’m less concerned initially about the performance, a cursory glance spots some easy wins there. To be fair to me, some of them are a hold over from the theme I have based the site on, but I will aim to address them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>However, the accesibility score of 65 does raise some eyebrows!</p>

<p>An hour or so minor tweaks, and a more extensive than I had hoped dive into the slider plugin I am using and we now have a much better score.</p>

<h3 id="now-onto-darkmode">Now onto darkmode!</h3>
<p>Able to now say that at least my site is pretty accessible, onto what I actually wanted to look at - adding a dark mode toggle.</p>

<p>Researching the best methods for implimenting this I came across an article on the ever-useful CSS tricks. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/">Read the article.</a> This exhaustive article really does cover everything you could need to know about implimenting a dark mode, including supporting the ‘prefers-color-scheme’ functionality.</p>

<p>So that’s the next plan for this site, a user friendly toggle that respects the users presets. Lets see how that pans out!</p>
