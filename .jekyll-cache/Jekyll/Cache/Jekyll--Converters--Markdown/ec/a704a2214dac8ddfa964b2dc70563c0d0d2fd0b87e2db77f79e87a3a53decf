<p>So far you have met the more mundane of my retinue. Here I introduce to you Voignich. I understandably keep it out of view except in the direst of circumstance. The creation of one such as this is enough to spur my more puritan colleagues to brand me heretic, but how else am I to both practice my craft?</p>

<p>I was taught the fundamentals of banishment, and later binding by my mentor – however I have since refined these through my own study, experiment and observation. It, for it can’t be considered a he or a she, was originally bound prior even to Augustine, but the events there that lead to Armitage’s mishap have lead me to… enhance it. Voignich is at once an ongoing experiment, a repository of knowledge and a weapon of last resort.</p>

<p>Bound not only in the chains you may see on other hosts, there are various devices of my own creation to contain it. Items of, or created from relics of holy significance. Take for example the cage it wears about its head, or the bells fastened to it – both taken from the vaults beneath chapels in Augustine’s primary reliquary – Items charged with devotion of countless imperial servants. But there are others, bones, pouches of soil, skulls of prior hosts…</p>

<p>Experiments in binding aside, Voignich absorbs knowledge for me. Proscribed or forbidden texts are given to it, allowing me to call upon the knowledge without exposing acolytes to potential harm.</p>

<p>If nothing else I learn my lessons.</p>
