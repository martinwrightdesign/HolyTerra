        Ferrus is gone, and with him my obligation of stewardship. I cannot wait idle while all we have built is torn down. I will turn the keys I bear and unleash that which is in my keeping upon those who have sided with the Warmaster. They deserve no better than these horrors. I will become the architect of their end. The Sons of Ferrus will not be found wanting, we will not fall

        ‚Äî Maelum Gwar
    </p>
</div>

<p>Gawr is a near mythical figure in the Xth, his name appears throughout the legion‚Äôs history, often tied with Ferrus‚Äô nascent Tactical Dreadnaught armour programme - particularly the prototyping of the Gorgon pattern suits - and envoy missions to Mechanicum Forgeworlds.</p>

<p>Upon assignment as ward to one of Ferrus‚Äô forbidden technology caches and hidden from the wider galaxy, records of his service abruptly end prior to the outbreak of Horus‚Äô rebellion; he is presumed lost to the legion.</p>

<p>Waiting on the galaxy‚Äôs edge, word of Ferrus‚Äô fall reached his remote station, Gawr marshalled the disparate forces of the tech-covens available to him. Supplemented by the forbidden technology he guarded, Gwar moved core-ward seeking only to wound the traitors as his legion had been wounded.</p>

<p>He is a hulking, ticking bionic brute in artificer plate from the earliest Terminator experiments. More machine than man, even by the standards of other Iron Fathers, he has collected vast bionics over his tenure of various forgeworlds and during his seclusion in the outer rim, distorting the already exaggerated silhouette even further.</p>
